The [Reddit/r/Simulate](http://www.reddit.com/r/simulate) team's SpaceApp! [One of the two apps selected by NASA](https://2014.spaceappschallenge.org/location/virtual/) out of 75+ apps in the "virtual participation" category to be included in People's Choice voting!

Cosmosium is an open-source game engine built especially for space-based games. Our goal is to make space game-crafting easier through easy-to-use game modules common in space games. This means built-in scenes, models, economy-handling, tech-trees, and REAL scientific data on celestial bodies. The engine is still in heavy development, but we are looking for more collaborators to help drive our design decisions. Please don't hesitate to contact us if you'd like to use our engine for your game idea.
